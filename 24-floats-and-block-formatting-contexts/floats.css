/*
  FLOATS
1-The default values:
. float: none
. clear: none

2.The possible values for 'clear property': left, right, none, both

3. The rule associated with the floats: the element that we firstly float will be displayed first, and the second will be secondly displayed.

4. Actually, we can float other elements besides images but the element will be removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow.

5. We can create columns with floats and it is the easiest way to do so by setting flout right and left with each one's width.

  BFC(Block formatting context)
1. A Block Formatting Context is part of the visual CSS rendering of a web page in which block boxes are laid out. A block formatting context (BFC) will lay child elements out according to block layout rules

2.  We can 'clear' a float by creating a block formatting context on the parent, this is achieved by putting a certain set of properties on the container. These properties are:
clear:both;
the pseudo-elements :after
overflow:hidden
3. I will not forget it tomorrow but I need to understand it more in order to always remember it.
