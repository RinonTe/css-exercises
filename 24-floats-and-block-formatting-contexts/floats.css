/*
  FLOATS
1-The default values:
. float: none
. clear: none

2.The possible values for 'clear property': left, right, none, both

3. The float content must go before anything else.

4. Actually, we can float other elements besides images but sometimes we need to change the display.

5. We can create columns with floats and it is the easiest way to do so by setting flout right and left with each one's width.

  BFC(Block formatting context)
1. A Block Formatting Context is part of the visual CSS rendering of a web page in which block boxes are laid out. A block formatting context (BFC) will lay child elements out according to block layout rules.

2.  We can 'clear' a float by creating a block formatting context on the parent, this is achieved by putting a certain set of properties on the container. These properties are:
position: absolute;
display: flow-root;
we need to put the overflow in order to makeit work.

3. I will not forget it tomorrow but I need to understand it more in order to always remember it.
