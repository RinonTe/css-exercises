      <h1>An essay on box-model</h1>
      <h2>Box model</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      It is said that all web developers should know what <q>box model</q> is and it is really important to understand
      how it works. We are going to learn about it in this essay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, let's define what <q>box model</q> is. It is mostly about designing and layout in <abbr
        title="Cascading Style Sheet"> CCS </abbr>.
      The <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet"> CCS</abbr>. Box model is the box that wraps around every html element.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need to understand it otherwise we will not be able to create layouts with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">
        CCS</abbr> or to align items with other items. The browser creats a box for
      each element according to the atandard <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet"> CCS</abbr> basic model but we
      control the size, position, and properties of the box by using <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet"> CCS</abbr>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every box is contained of four areas, defined by their respective edges: the content edge, padding edge, border
      edge, and margin edge.
